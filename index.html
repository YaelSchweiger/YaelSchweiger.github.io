<h2 style="font-family: Arial">Hi, <br> This is me, Yael Schweiger. <br> Nice to meet you.</h2>
	
	<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size 16px">
	I am ideas architect. My passions in life were always understanding, verbalising and making visions come true, whether it's me that's actually doing them, or helping others to do so. <br> I have passion for beautiful, smart and elegant things: it could be a smart logo design or a surprising building architecture.
	<br>I'm a people person.
	<br>I love getting my hands dirty and creating something new by myself, no matter how much work it takes.</p>
	</p>
	<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size 16px">My best self is when I am doing a project (of any kind) with other people - the interaction, the creation and the problem solving - they all move me and make my days and nights filled with passion and doing-atmosphere. </p>
